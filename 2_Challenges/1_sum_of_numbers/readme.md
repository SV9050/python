PSEUDOCODE TO FIND SUM OF 'N' USING FOR LOOP

Ask the user to input a number and store it in variable `N`. 
Set a variable `total` to 0. This will hold the sum of numbers from 0 to `N`.
Use For Loop for the variable 'added_value' in range N+1:
Make total += added_value -  this increase the value of value total from 0 to 1, and it repeats the loop  
After the loop ends, print the value of `total`.
