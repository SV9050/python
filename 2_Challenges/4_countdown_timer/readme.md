PSEUDOCODE FOR COUNTDOWN TIMER

Set variable `countdown` to 10.
Start a loop that continues as long as `countdown` is greater than 0:
    - Print the current value of `countdown`.
    - Ask the user for input with the prompt "Should I stop?" and store the response in variable 'response'.
    - Decrease the value of `countdown` by 1.
    - If the user response is `"yes"`:
        - Break out of the loop.
- Otherwise:
        - Continue to the next iteration.
