PSEUDO CODE
 
1. Define two sets of numbers
  SET set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
  SET set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

2. Calculate the intersection
   intersection = set1.intersection(set2)

3. Print the intersection
  PRINT "Intersection:", intersection

4. Calculate the union without modifying set1
  union = set1.union(set2)

5. Print the union result
  PRINT "Union:", union

6.  Update set1 to remove numbers that are in set2 (difference)
  difference = set1.difference(set2)

7. Print the updated set1 after removing elements from set2
  PRINT "Difference:", difference
